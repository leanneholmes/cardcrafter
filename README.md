<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://cardcrafter-d6673.web.app) <img src="https://i.ibb.co/18Nj1yB/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Preview"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/dGnXmC7/thumbnail-3.jpg" alt="Preview">

This is a web application developed in less than 24 hours for the <b>Codedex Holiday Hackathon '23!</b> The chosen track was "In the Holiday Spirit".
Main app features include:
* Authentication with Google Firebase
* Personalized user experience with greetings and saved cards
* Data persistence with Firestore. Create, read, and delete documents
* Create an e-card from 3 preset templates
* A unique URL for every created card, so users can easily share them with family and friends

I wanted to make something with a bright and cheerful interface to get people excited for the holiday season. The concept for this app allowed a lot of creativity for both the frontend UI as well as the e-card design.

## Challenges

I had to trim a few features from the application because of schedule constraints. I ran into significant difficulty implementing the authentication and CRUD operations with Firebase. I have not worked with it in over a couple of years, and there have been significant changes to the syntax with limited helpful examples online. 

I also had several issues creating my build files. I was unable to host on Vercel and Netlify, and eventually had to host on Firebase.  

Challenges aside, I did not use any pre-built UI elements or template code to make this. Everything was from scratch, and I'm incredibly proud of how it looks. I'm also very glad I was able to get it deployed in time!
