<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://cardcrafter-d6673.web.app) <img src="https://i.ibb.co/18Nj1yB/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Preview"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Fz3Twpj/thumbnail-3.jpg" alt="Preview"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9TQpwz4/thumbnail-4.jpg"> 

This is a web application developed in less than 24 hours for the <b>Codedex Holiday Hackathon '23!</b> The chosen track was "In the Holiday Spirit".
Main app features include:
* Authentication with Google Firebase
* Personalized user experience with greetings and saved cards
* Data persistence with Firestore. Create, read, and delete documents
* Create an e-card from 3 preset templates
* A unique URL for every created card, so users can easily share them with family and friends

I wanted to make something with a bright and cheerful interface to get people excited for the holiday season. The concept for this app allowed a lot of creativity for both the frontend UI as well as the e-card design.

## Challenges

I had to trim a few features from the application because of schedule constraints. I ran into many problems implementing the authentication and CRUD operations with Firebase. It was tough to find examples online as much of it was written with outdated syntax. 

I also had several issues creating my build files. I was unable to host on Vercel and Netlify, and eventually had to host on Firebase.

Challenges aside, I did not use any pre-built UI elements or template code to make this. Everything was written from scratch, and I'm incredibly pleased with how it turned out. I'm also very glad I was able to get it deployed in time!
